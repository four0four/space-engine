- Make the engine class
	- (Obviously) contains everything else
	- Reason: with things like texturelist, we need 
		something that can store those, and globals are bad
		- Speaking of globals, they will do for now. JUST ADD THIS LATER
- Keep in mind: we're using gl coords as global (map/world!) coords, at least for now.
- Render to texture 
- Layers
	- DO THIS NOW
	- It will make things easier, I promise. Especially backgrounds
- Add more shit to the todo
- Find the old todo, add its shit to this todo


----REALLY LONG TERM----

- Toroidal map!
- Procedural planets
	- procedural background?


----Classes----
-Engine
	-Layer
		-Shader
		-Sprites/Objects (text, buttons, etc)
        	-Shader
			-Texture
		-Texture (optional)
