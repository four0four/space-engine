- Make the engine class
	- (Obviously) contains everything else
	- Reason: with things like texturelist, we need 
		something that can store those, and globals are bad
		- Speaking of globals, they will do for now. JUST ADD THIS LATER
- Keep in mind: we're using gl coords as global (map/world!) coords, at least for now.
- Render to texture 
- Layers
- Add more shit to the todo
- Find the old todo, add its shit to this todo
